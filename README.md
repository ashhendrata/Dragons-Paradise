## Dragon's Paradise

**The name of my game is "Dragon's Paradise". While your dragon will have an abundance of food here, other dragons will also be competing with you in the skies. And they're going to do what it takes so beware!**

Game mechanics:
- the speed of the game can be controlled using + and - buttons
- Your dragon is controlled using the up, down, left, right keys
- When the enemy dragon collides with you, one live will be taken and an OUCH effect will appear
- When two enemy dragons collide with one another, a bloodbath will ensue, killing both of them off
- When you come in contact with a flying pig, your energy levels will improve
- Remember that your enemy dragons can eat them too!
- Most excitingly, when you fly into a gold cloud, you'll be invicible against the enemy and for a few seconds, your dragon's skin flashing rainbow for the time being


**How can you win? Get an energy level of 300!**

**How can you lose? Lose all lives!**
