# 🐲 Dragon's Paradise 🐉

*Award: Most Creative Theme*

**This is "Dragon's Paradise". While your dragon will have an abundance of food here, other dragons will also be competing with you in the skies. And they're going to do what it takes so beware!**

## Game Instructions:
- 🔥 Use the ↑, ↓, →, and ← key to control your dragon
- 🚀 To speed up or slow down the pace of the game, use the + and - keys
- 🐷 Eat as many flying pigs as you can. They improve your energy level! But don't forget, the enemy wants to devour them too.
- 🪦 Avoid the enemy dragons. Each collision with one of them means one life lost. Watch out for the OUCH visual effect!
- 🌈 To become attain temporary invincibility, fly into a gold cloud. You will be invicible against the enemy temporarily and your dragon's scales will flash rainbows! 
- 🩸When two enemy dragons collide with one another, a bloodbath will ensue, killing both of them off. Perhaps the enemy of your enemy is your friend?

&nbsp;

## Fan Favorites:
- ⭐ **Invincibility mode**: Your dragon achieves pure power through invincibility. For a few seconds, no enemy can hurt you. In this mode, clear as many of the enemies off the sky. It's the perfect time for revenge.
- ⭐️ **Bloodbath**: Watch your enemies battle one another. We know it always ends badly for all of them!
